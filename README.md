---About me---

Hello, my name is Å½ilvinas and I'm a student of Computer Science. 
I mainly program in C++ and JAVA. I like OOP.
Now learning a bit of Scheme and JS.

"Good Change" is my motto and nickname (it's kaizen in Japanese)
01 should mean "striving to be No.1" but also you can interpret it as binary if you wish.
